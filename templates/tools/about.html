<h2> About This Service</h2>
<p>You can use these online tools to clean up HTML produced by such tools as Microsoft Word, Libre Office, Calibre and various Content Management Systems. 
<p>This service is optimized for producing HTML for SuttaCentral, but can be used by anyone for any purpose, if you want more options, consider using tidy directly http://w3c.github.io/tidy-html5/. If you are a developer check <a href="http://github.com/suttacentral/suttacentral">github</a> where the python scripts which are used under the hood are available (under sc/tools).

<h2>Format required for SuttaCentral</h2>

<p>If you are working on texts for SuttaCentral, or would like to submit some texts, please follow this process:
<ol>
<li> <h3>Get HTML files of the source.</h3> <p>This may involve crawling a website with a tool like HTTrack, or converting a .doc or .odt file into HTML in Microsoft Word or LibreOffice. Please make sure you have permission.
<li> <h3>Perform preliminary cleanup</h3><p>Put the files in a zip and upload to the Cleanup tool to give them a preliminary sanitization and normalization. Using the correct settings with the Cleanup tool can save a lot of manual work especially when the HTML files are generated by a word processor or Content Management system.
<li> <h3>Required information</h3><p>We need to have the following information for every sutta:
<ul>
<li> The <em>Sutta Unique ID (uid)</em>, this forms the URL on SuttaCentral. Digha Nikaya 1, becomes legacy.suttacentral.net/<strong>dn1</strong>/pi, <abbr>dn1</abbr> is the uid. <abbr>sn56.11</abbr> is the uid for the dhammacakkapavattana sutta.
<p> The preferred way to specify the sutta uid is by <em>naming the file the uid</em>, for example <code>dn1.html</code>, this will keep things very clear. Another way, which permits submitting multiple suttas per file, is to wrap each sutta in a <code>&lt;section id="uid"&gt;</code> tag.
<li><p> The <strong>language</strong>. On sutta central we use a <strong>Language Unique ID</strong> for each language. In most cases, the language uid will be identical to the language ISO code, for example 'en' for english, 'de' for german.
<p>The preferred way to specify the language uid, is by creating a folder named the language uid, and putting all the files of that language in that folder. Zip the whole lot up and submit it.

<li> <h3>Metadata is an absolute requirement.</h3> <p> See some existing texts for examples of metadata. However in brief metadata should contain:
<ul>
<li> The translator and/or editor (Root texts, such as Pali, do not have translators), use an <code>&lt;author&gt;</code> tag
<li> The edition or website the text is from, use a <code>&lt;cite&gt;</code> tag.
<li> The license the text is made available under, if applicable.
<li> <em> The above are not hard and fast requirements, however there must be some kind of metadata giving some kind of attribution</em>
</ul>
<p> Metadata may be included in a <code>&lt;div id="metaarea"&gt;</code> tag. If the same metadata applies to many files, you may put the metadata in a file named <code>meta.html</code> and include that file in the same folder as the files it applies to.

<p> For example a submission of German texts, may involve zipping up a structure like this:
<ul class="filelist">
<li> de/dn1.html
<li> de/dn2.html
<li> de/dn16.html
<li> de/meta.html
</ul>
</ul>
<li> <h3>Presentation of content.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Every sutta should be headed by an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> heading. This may be preceded by a division or subdivision subheading.
<li>If there are subsections in a sutta, these should be headed by <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> through <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> headings, when there are subheadings, a menu will be generated automatically.
<li> All paragraphs should use a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag.
<li> Verses should be contained within a <code>&lt;blockquote class="gatha"&gt;</code>, each set of verses (i.e. four lines) should be in a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag, the lines should be separated by a <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tag. If there are multiple sets of verses in a row, all should be contained in the same <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code>.
<li> If the sutta starts with "Evaṁ me sutaṁ" (or a translation thereof), this should be wrapped in a <code>&lt;span class="evam"&gt;</code>
<li> The above will generally suffice to create a well-presented text. There are many, many details of possible markup. Please inspect similar existing texts for classes which can be used. You can get clean copies of the texts from <a href="https://legacy.suttacentral.net/downloads">legacy.suttacentral.net/downloads</a>, or examine the texts on the site itself, using your browsers right click menu 'inspect element' tool.
</ul>
<li> <h3> Submitting texts to SuttaCentral</h3>
<p>Once the texts have been edited (or even before) you can try uploading them to the Finalize tool. This will report any errors (serious problems which cannot be resolved automatically), and also give information on how it interepts information, for example it will say what sutta and what language it thinks each file refers to. The Finalize tool will take care of many finnicky details of markup and is quite tolerant of the input not being exactly right.
Presently, you need to e-mail the zip to a SuttaCentral team member, unless you have direct access to the github data repository.
