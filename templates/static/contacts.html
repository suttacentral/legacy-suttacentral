<h1>SuttaCentral People</h1>

<p>SuttaCentral was conceived and designed by the collective imaginations of Venerable Anālayo (Germany), Rod Bucknell (Australia), and Bhante Sujato (Australia), based on sutta correspondence tables compiled by Rod Bucknell and Ven. Anālayo.</p>

<p>The initial launch of the site was in 2005. Key people involved with that launch were:</p>

<ul>

<li>Ong Yong Peng (Australia)—system, database and web design; web programming.</li>

<li>John Kelly (Australia)—project coordination; system and database design; database and data administration; data entry.</li>

<li>Hugo Gayosso (USA), Chris Kang (Australia)—data entry.</li>

</ul>

<p>In late 2012 we began a new redesign, with the core team being Rod Bucknell, John Kelly, and Bhante Sujato. This was originally spurred by John Kelly’s work assisting Bhikkhu Bodhi on the Aṅguttara Nikāya translation, which resulted in a number of new parallels being discovered. However we decided to go beyond just making some additions, and have embarked on a complete redesign. While the data structure has been retained with only incremental improvements, the entire code for the website has been rewritten. For this new edition, the main team is as follows.</p>

<p>Rod Bucknell—lead researcher, parallels and references.</p>

<p>In addition, we express our grateful thanks to the following, in no particular order. SuttaCentral exists to draw together the diverse strands of the early Buddhist tradition, and we can only do this through the help of many people.</p>
