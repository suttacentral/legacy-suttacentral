<h2>A professional, full-time developer</h2>

<p>The content on SuttaCentral has been made possible by volunteers. While their contribution is irreplaceable, we believe that these teachings are of such significance, and the work involved so great, that it is time for us to employ a full time developer. </p>

<p>We are fortunate to have the services of Blake Walsh, one of the few people in the world who is qualified in the Buddhist texts and languages, and also in progamming. With your support, Blake will be able to work full time to make SuttaCentral even better.</p>

<p>Our target is to raise $1000/week to continue to employ Blake, and support the other costs of SuttaCentral.</p>

<h2>How can I help?</h2>

<p>You can contact our volunteer financial manager, Deepika Weerakoon (suttacentraldevelopmenttrust@gmail.com). Deepika manages the funds on behalf of SuttaCentral Development Trust. Consider making a monthly donation, to help us pay the regular wages. </p>
